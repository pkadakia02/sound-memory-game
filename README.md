Link to project: (insert your link here, should start with https://glitch.com...)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [X] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [X] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
 - I used W3Schools for help
 - Also used YouTube: https://youtu.be/1Rq_LrpcgIM
 - Other than that, no other tools other than the ones provided
 

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
  
    When completing this submission, the step by step guide really helped me understand what we had to do and why we had to do it.
  Through reading it and following along, I gained a much better understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. One challenge 
  that I did face was when I was trying to work on the extra components. I wanted to try and complete as many as possible. 
  Of the extra components that I attempted, the one that I took the most time with was making it so the sequence is different 
  every time. The implementation of Math.random() took a bit of research since it was new to me. Although the concept of it was 
  not too challenging, I did want to try to understand it as best as I could before I used it. I looked at a couple resources, 
  such as the ones provided and W3Schools to understand it. I also wanted a YouTube video to better help me. It did not take too 
  long to understand, and after a bit of trial and error, I was able to get the function running successfully. I also tried to 
  implement an image for the button, but unfortunately I did not think it looked better than the button is currently, so I went 
  back to the regular button.


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

  After completing this, I still have a couple questions about web-development. I would like to know the limits that come with
  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Although there seems to be a lot of great features and options with them, I wonder if there are
  some things that they cannot provide for you and you may have to use another web-development tool for. But it is entirely
  possible that these applications do allow for complex websites, just that I have not been exposed to them yet. I am 
  still curious about how a career in web development would look. This project caught my interest, so I plan on learning more
  about it in the future. 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
  
  If I had more time to work on this project, I would likely try to make it multiple memory games rather than 1. For example, I
would have a main menu that would have buttons leading to different games. One of the games would obviously be this sound and
memory game. But I would want to add more options, such as a card matching game, or a game such as the one where numbers 
disappear and you have to recall them by clicking on them in the right order. For this game specifically, I would want to make it
as customizable as possible. I would want the user to be able to choose the amount of buttons, the amount of time, the total 
amount of numbers to win, etc. I would also want to implement a way to grade a person's memory, such as telling them they have 
an "above-average" memory if they do well, a "needs more practice" message if they struggle, and more.
